# DLS-Project
Deep Learning Systems Final Project

# Implementation

In this repository, we store the code for our Deep Learning Systems Project. In this project we try to estimate the velocity of a vehicle from a single camera from inside the car. 

## Data

We got the data from the [speed challenge](https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge) which was a competition held by comma.ai in 2017. 

### Optical Flow
We used optical flow to capture the movement between frames. (__OPTICAL-FLOW-EXPLANATION__) We used OpenCV to calculate the optical flow. 

## Model



# Results
this should contain evaluation results.
